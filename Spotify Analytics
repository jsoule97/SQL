# For this project, I downloaded Spotify data from Kaggle.
# Then I created a table to insert Spotify data into.
# Finally, I performed analytics on the data using SQL. 

#Creating the table: 
CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness text NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL 
)

#Then I inserted the Spotify Data .csv into the table.

#Next, I explored the data using the following SQL. 

#1. What is the average danceability and energy by artist and track?
SELECT track_name, artist_name, AVG(danceability), AVG(energy)
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name, track_name;

#2. What are the top 10 most popular artists?
SELECT artist_name, track_name, popularity
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY popularity DESC
LIMIT 10;

#3. What artists released the longest song?
SELECT artist_name, track_name, duration_ms
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY duration_ms DESC
LIMIT 1;

#4. What is the average danceability for the top 10 most popular songs?
SELECT track_name, artist_name, AVG(danceability)
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY track_name
ORDER BY popularity DESC;

#5. Show the titles and popularity for songs with a tempo of less than 100.
SELECT track_name, artist_name, popularity, tempo
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
WHERE tempo < 100
ORDER BY tempo;

#6. Which song is the loudest?
SELECT track_name, artist_name, loudness
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY loudness DESC
LIMIT 1;
